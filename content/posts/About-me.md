From a young age, I was always very drawn into technology and understanding how everything worked but also use it to improve my life and anyone surrounding me and I think this was what drove me in going into an IT path where my work could have an impact, meaning and help improve others life in some way.

I'm very young in blockchain technology and I do feel so "green" but more than the knowledge about it, I truly believe that is a way of returning the control, power and improve the lives of everyone and not only benefit major corporations or companies that want to keep things centralized and would be so meaningful to be involved and contribute to this positive change with the work and experience that I already acquired throughout my life.

I took a professional course in my high school and jumped directly into work around my 20's and grew my way from a help desk into a system administrator/engineer working in different sized clients here on my sunny Portugal.
I truly believe that being a curious and self-taught person always wanting and open to learning was what given me opportunities to grow but I'm also very grateful to everyone that believed and me and made that possible, be it leads, family or friends.
In my 30's my curiosity with startups, remote and distributed teams,  the culture needed to make them work and be successful made me take a step into freelancing during 2 years with clients around the globe, and a while after it, I started in my current role where I currently take care of all the  IT operations for 3 companies of one Group

I also want to learn, have more exposure, and grow in areas like coding, SRE, as it's an area that sparks curiosity in me, and when I'm not working  I'm learning photography, I read about stoic philosophy, I indulge in some binge-watching of TV series, console gaming and love having some cozy dinners with my friends and family, for me food is sharing.

You can count on someone humble, honest, who loves transparent, direct communication, and build trust and meaningful relations, I'm a bit introverted but always grateful for working in the area I choose and love.
